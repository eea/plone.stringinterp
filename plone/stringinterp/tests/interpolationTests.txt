Base Interpolation Tests
========================

Basics
------

plone.stringinterp.Interpolate will do ${id} style interpolation
using string substitutions provided by named adapters.

Let's test basic interpolation using the homepage::

    >>> from plone.stringinterp import Interpolator

    >>> s = """one two three ${title} ${url} ${nonesuch}"""

    >>> apage = self.portal['front-page']

    >>> Interpolator(apage)(s)
    u'one two three Welcome to Plone http://nohost/plone/front-page ???'
    
That was a direct call. Let's do it by adapter, too, proving this
may be swapped out.

    >>> from plone.stringinterp.interfaces import IStringInterpolator
    >>> IStringInterpolator(apage)(s)
    u'one two three Welcome to Plone http://nohost/plone/front-page ???'
